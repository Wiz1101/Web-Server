# Web-Server
This is a simple implementation of http WebServer in Java

You can run the app using Commands: 
1. javac Main.java
2. java Main [port] public

The program contains only one java class.
After running the two commands above, you can navigate from your browser to localhost:<port> and start using the app.

The redirection is reachable by clicking the button at 302.html
the internal server error can be triggered by requesting /test.html. This is not a html file, it will simply trigger an error in the Main.java.
